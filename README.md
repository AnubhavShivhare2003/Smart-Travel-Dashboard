# Smart Travel Dashboard

Welcome! This project is a showcase of modern web APIs and modern React animation in a real-world dashboard. It demonstrates how to build a user-friendly, visually engaging dashboard that adapts to your environment and location, using:

- **Geolocation API**

- **OpenWeatherMap API**
- **React Spring Animations**
- **Google Gemini AI (Travel Suggestions)**
- **React Leaflet (Interactive Map)**

## üåç What does it do?
- Detects your location and shows your coordinates and accuracy (with animated map pin)
- Plots your position on a live interactive map (React Leaflet)

- Detects your network speed/type and warns if slow or offline (with animated WiFi card)
- Lets you save, nickname, and export your travel history
- Shows beautiful, AI-powered travel suggestions for your area (Gemini API)
- Automatically switches between light and dark mode based on time, with manual theme toggle
- Fully responsive, modern UI with smooth SVG animations (React Spring)
